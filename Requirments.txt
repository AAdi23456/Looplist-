LoopList – Social Streak Tracker for Micro-Habits
Scenario:
Everyone wants to build better habits — but most habit trackers are either private and dull, or overly complex. What’s missing is a streak-first, publicly accountable, visually rewarding system to make micro-habit building fun.

LoopList lets users commit to tiny recurring habits, track streaks visually, and share public commitment boards where others can cheer, clone, or compete.

🎯 Objective:
Build a fullstack app where users can:

Create recurring micro-habits (aka loops)
Track their daily progress and streaks
Make habit boards public or private
Explore trending habits and clone them
React or cheer others’ public loops
👥 User Role: user
Only one role — users can track their own habits, browse public ones, and interact with others through reactions and cloning.

🔐 Authentication & Authorization:
Secure login/signup via email
All habit loops and progress data are private by default
Public boards can be explored without login, but reactions/clones require auth
🧱 Core Functional Features:
1. Create a Loop
Form includes:

Loop Title (e.g., “Read 10 pages”, “No sugar after 7pm”)
Frequency: Daily / 3x per week / Weekdays / Custom
Start Date
Public toggle: Private, Public, Friends Only
Optional: emoji icon or cover image
2. Track Your Streaks
Daily check-in: tap to mark as done
Loop state:
🔥 Active → if streak is ongoing
⏸️ Broken → if a day is missed
✅ Completed → if a loop had a time limit
Show:
Current streak
Longest streak
Completion rate
Loop heatmap calendar (inspired by GitHub)
3. Public Loop Boards
Users can view others’ public loops:
“Cheer” with an emoji reaction
“Clone this loop” to try it themselves
See how many others are doing it
Board shows:
Loop title
Creator
Total followers
Community success rate (aggregate data)
4. My Loop Dashboard
Overview of all your loops:
Tabs: Active, Paused, Completed
Streak counter for each
Daily checklist
Filter by frequency or tag
5. Explore Section
Filter trending loops by:
Most cloned
Highest streak holders
Categories: Health, Focus, Discipline, Fun
“Loop of the Day” feature with banner-style highlight
6. Clone + Remix
Clicking “Clone” adds the loop to your dashboard
You can rename, change emoji, adjust frequency before starting

7. UI/UX Must-Haves
Loop cards with animated streak meters
Visual streak heatmaps
Gentle nudge for missed check-ins (“Let’s get back on track!”)
Mobile-first layout with swipe/tap interactions
🧪 Additional Notes:
Streak logic must be time-aware (no skipping days)
Reacting to loops is limited to once per day per loop
Private loops are fully hidden unless toggled public
Bonus: implement soft social leaderboard for mutual follows


rules--
use next.js for frontend
strictly follow the requirments.txt and do not skip anything written in requirments.txt



Before proceeding with any changes, please ensure the following steps are followed:

1. **Revert any previously incorrect implementations** to maintain codebase integrity.

2. **Standardize Data Fetching via Services**:
   - For example, in the Dashboard module, use the `dashboardService` to fetch data.
   - Define a function like:

     ```javascript
     getDashboardData(someParam) {
       // Call the backend API (to be implemented later) call the relevent API and comment that later it will get uncommented when API will be implemented
       // For now, return some dummy/mock data
     }
     ```

   - Always call this function from the component (e.g., Dashboard component) to retrieve data.

3. **Maintain Consistency Across Modules**:
   - Apply this approach uniformly across all modules in the project.
   - This ensures better separation of concerns, easier testing, and maintainable code.

✅ This pattern promotes a clean architecture and facilitates scalability.

🔁 Consistency is key. Ensure every module adheres to this structure.
